# JMQTT-Server
My try at building my own MQTT server in java

This is my first try at MQTT and GitHub. That's the reason I accidentaly included some resources 
that should not be here. The JSON and cucumber stuff should not be in this project. 
As I don't know how to remove them they will be here for an undetermind period of time.
